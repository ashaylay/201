        <p>Mickey had the remarkable ability to chat all the time. He loved attention and would often cry out for help if he was unable to find someone to satisfy his needs for affection. He enjoyed distracting his humans from accomplishing their homework by stretching out on those very assignments. </p>
        <p>Compared to his brother, Mugsy was more mature and relaxed. He loved the outdoors and seized every chance to venture beyond the secure confines of his home. His favorite outdoor activity was rolling around on patio cement. He loved to start his mornings by basking in the warmth of sunlight patches on the carpet.</p>
        <p>Mickey and Mugsy enjoyed each other's company; they would often sleep in chairs, on beds, or in their tower together. They had a daily routine of eating dinner together every night where Mugsy demonstrated patience with his brother as Mickey hogged the food bowl. Both believed that if there was any empty space at the bottom of their food bowl, the remaining food was inedible, resulting in their cries for a refill. In the mornings, they liked to play with one another by running around the house or engaging in rather intense wrestling matches.</p>

        <p>Storm is an exceptionally handsome bunny. With his sleek fur and lion-like mane, he was irrestiable to his companion, Misty. She has no fear in appearing stand-offish toward her caretakers. Nevertheless, they both loved to spend time together. Even in the extreme heat, they enjoyed lying side-by-side with each other. The highlight of their day was eating their luscious green feast of a breakfast together while listening to what their main caretaker says to them.</p>
